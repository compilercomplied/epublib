# Epublib

Epub processing library for python.


## Goals
1. Extract raw ordered text segments from epub files that adhere to epub spec.
1. Process files in a robust way while trying to point why a file does not adhere to the spec.
1. Heavily tested to support contributions and evolution of the library.

## Non-goals
1. Writing epubs.
1. Handling anything other than raw text output (no media, styles and similar things).


## Contributing
I'll try to keep an eye on the repo in case anyone wants to extend or modify this code.

Goals and non-goals ultimately shall reflect whatever needs people might have, as long as it keeps the focus on sustainability.


## Acknowledgements
